But if you look&nbsp;<strong>Norway</strong>, country that have the lowest avg CO2 emissions in EU, its market share of new vehicles that are Electric in&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>&nbsp; is&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">42.4%</strong>&nbsp;. So, how did Norway succeeded in promoting EV? To encourage the purchase of EVs, Norway introduced a comprehensive package of generous tax incentives, including the exemption of EVs from the registration tax, VAT and motor fuel taxes, as well as at least a 50% reduction in road taxes, and ferry and parking fees. I suggest other countries to try and implement some of those tax incentives and customize the package with what your country can afford.&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">Share of Renewable consumption energy of&nbsp;<strong>Norway&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">69.2%</strong>, where as&nbsp;<strong>Luxembourg</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Netherlands</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Belgium</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>France</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>UK</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Greece</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">&lt; 15%</strong>. These countries need to take advantage of the supporting schemes like feed-in-premium, Quota obligations with tradable green certificates, Loan guarantees, soft loans, Investment grants, Tax incentives, Tendering schemes offered by the government to establish renewable energy power plants.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">While Electric Vehicles can significantly reduce carbon emissions, the next thing to focus on to achieve net zero carbon emissions is the decarbonization of production of materials that's used in Electric vehicles particularly batteries. To do this, equipment manufacturers will need to make internal changes by establishing transparency on the emissions embedded in their upstream activities, educate and train engineers understand the carbon impacts of design decisions and incorporate carbon targets alongside established industry metrics such as cost and performance.&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">Automotive Industry will need to identify critical changes that need to be made in the value chain, like rethinking the end of life of a vehicle, which right now is left up to individual manufacturers. They must develop industry wide standards and approaches to collaboration that focus on sustainability.&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">As for what an individual can do to reduce CO2 emissions, buy net zero emission vehicle, use the bike-share programs if your city or town has them, take public transit when possible, carpool with friends instead of driving alone, use ride-sharing services. Install Solar panels on rooftop of your house to have clean energy source.</li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1189/6/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>

As an Electrical Engineer I am drawn to do a report on Electrical Vehicles but someone already done that project here. So, I kept on looking and found this dataset that have data on EVs coming to market each year in Europe, each countries energy consumption sources how its Carbon emissions changing. The challenging part now is, I am not sure about which industry this data belongs to like transport, energy sector or Environment Agency, to figure out KPIs. So, I researched on google how the carbon emissions are tracked and what are mitigation strategies. Looking at how to reduce CO2 emission from Transport are implemented, I came up with these KPIs.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">KPI that I choose for renewable energy consumption is not conveying variation after plotting in chart for each country. If you look at Norway, its energy consumption from renewables is already high and YoY change for this country is not changing much. (Norway is leading the world in all the things I am talking about in this dashboard). So, I need to look at data again and rethink about what to plot on chart to better represent the message I am trying to convey. I came up with overall renewable consumption share for each country.&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">I want to show the relation between EVs coming into the market, change in Renewable energy usage and how its effecting CO2 emissions in each country in one plot. Choosing a plot for this is a bit of challenging for me. I decided on what to put on x-axis and y-axis easily but to decide on what to choose to show change in bubble size and variation in the bubble color didnâ€™t come naturally. Mentor suggested what values to add on those fields and I looked at other projects to come up with solution.</li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1189/3/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
